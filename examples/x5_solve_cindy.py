- You have some number `n` of black marbles and the same number of white marbles
- You have a playing board which consists simply of a line of `2n+1` spaces to put the marbles in
- Start with the black marbles all at one end (say, the left), the white marbles all at the other end, and a free space in between
- The *goal* is to reverse the positions of the marbles
- The black marbles can only move to the right, and the white marbles can only move to the left (no backing up)
- At each move, a marble can either:
    - Move one space ahead, if that space is clear, or
    - Jump ahead over exactly one marble of the opposite color, if the space just beyond that marble is clear
